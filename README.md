# Keydeem
Laziness, optimized. Redeem keys from your clipboard with a keystroke.

## Use this
[Download a release.](https://github.com/antigravities/Keydeem) Rebind keys by right-clicking the key icon in the tray. Don't redistribute your auth.json or sentry.bin files, you twit.

## Build this
I use VS2017. Open the solution, restore the NuGet packages, and then build it. Piece of cake.
